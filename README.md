ST_Tensorflow_Project
===================

TensorFlow project implementing Artistic Style Transfer w/Deep Neural Networks. Add styles from famous paintings to any photo in a fraction of a second!

----------


Plan:
-------------
1. Code.
a. training script to train a style and save the CNN.
b. styling script to take input image and use trained CNN to transfer style.

2. Train Artistic Styles on gCloud GPU.

3. Test and modify weights if neccesary.

4. Set up evironment to allow easy application for users.
